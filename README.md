Features:

Darth Vader (the alien) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (the human) battle each other with randomized attacks.

If neither attacks, the background turns half-red and half-blue to represent the tie.

The background color changes dynamically:

Red when Darth Vader attacks.

Blue when Obi-Wan attacks.

Half-red, half-blue if there's a tie (when neither attacks).

The first character to have their opponent's health reduced to zero wins, but no points are awarded for a tie.

Tools Used:

CSS for styling the game interface, characters, and background.

Vanilla JavaScript for the game logic, including attacks, randomization, and tie detection.

HTML for structuring the layout.
